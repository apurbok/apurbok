Hi, I am a computer science graduate from BUET. I have learnt fundamentals of software development and computer science well. I have experiences in working with multiple programming languages, frameworks, databases, platforms, ml, analytical systems etc. My preferred operating system is macos but i am completely fine with linux/windows. My preferred code-sharing platform is github and i am used to both command prompts and UI (source tree). I want to build career as a good Software Engineer primarily but I may also have interest in pursuing phd degree later and involve my career in research fields. My positive sides are having positive mindset, perseverance, dedication, honesty. I always learn from mistakes and try to upgrade myself.
